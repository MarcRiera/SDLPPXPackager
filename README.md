# SDLPPX Packager

This utility is used to create Trados Return Package files (`SDLRPX`) from a `SDLPPX` file. Of course, it assumes you already have translated the content of the `SDLXLIFF` files inside.

## Installation

* To use the GUI: `java -jar SDLPPXPackager-1.0.0.jar`
* To use in CLI: `java -jar SDLPPXPackager-1.0.0.jar /path/to/project.sdlppx /path/to/target/files/`
